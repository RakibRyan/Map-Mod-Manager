# Map-Mod-Manager

Map Mod Manager is a tool for managing and organising your map mods. With a cell grid display, you can visually identify conflicts between maps, regardless of if you're subscribed to them or picked from the huge database of over 800 maps. Whether you're curating a fine collection of maps, checking your current subscriptions for conflicts or expanding your map collection, Map Mod Manager is the tool to help you do it.

<ul>
<li>
Interactive Cell Display: view maps on a detailed grid, highlighting selected mods to identify conflicts between themselves or vanilla areas. 
</li>   
<li>
Toggle Mods: quickly activate or deactivate mods and their dependencies you're already subscribed to, so you don't have to go back into mods to manage them.    
</li>
<li>
Steam Links: subscribing to a mod is as easy as clicking on that link and subscribing - if it works with your current collection, you can update it in seconds (with a refresh of the game, of course).  
</li>
<li>
Dependency Check: know what mods are required with your maps, ensuring you don't miss anything essential to prevent in-game issues like missing tiles or unexpected behaviour.  
</li>
<li>
Export Data: the export function generates a list of selected maps, including their URL's, dependencies and multiplayer data, enabling you to quickly set up a server or share it with a mate.
